# ðŸ§  Contextual Bandit for Dynamic Content Recommendation (Criteo CTR Dataset)

This project builds a live simulation and API for dynamic recommendation using Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits:
- LinUCB
- Thompson Sampling
- Epsilon-Greedy

It focuses on optimizing click-through rates (CTR) in a dynamic, exploration vs exploitation setting.
